Mu2E Field Mapping Documentation!
=================================

Analysis software for the Mu2E experiment at Fermilab.  This software leverages `numpy`, `scipy`,
`pandas`, and others in order to analyze the magnetic fields generated by the experiment solenoids.
The main goal of this software is to generate a full description of the magnetic fields by fitting a
sparse set of field measurements.

Software is included for data munging, plotting, fitting.
